#Simple Bank

This code creates a simple bank account system with the following features:

1.  **Account Creation**: Users can create a new account by registering with a unique username and password.
2.  **Login**: Users can login to their existing account using their username and password.
3.  **Account Balance**: The account balance is displayed on the screen and updated in real-time.
4.  **Deposit**: Users can deposit money into their account using the deposit form.
5.  **Withdrawal**: Users can withdraw money from their account using the withdrawal form.

Note that this is a basic implementation and does not include any security measures such as password hashing or encryption. In a real-world application, you would want to use a secure method to store and verify passwords.
